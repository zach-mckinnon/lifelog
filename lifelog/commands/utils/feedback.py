Lifelog Feedback Sayings Module
This module provides functionality to load and retrieve feedback sayings for various contexts.
It uses a JSON file to store the sayings and allows for easy retrieval of a random saying for a given context.
It is designed to be used in conjunction with the Lifelog CLI to provide user feedback and encouragement.
