# ü§ù Setting Up Lifelog for Public Collaboration

This guide covers creating a public repository branch and setting up the project for open collaboration.

## üöÄ Creating the Public Branch

### Step 1: Prepare Main Branch
```bash
# Ensure main branch is clean and ready
git status
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare codebase for public collaboration

- Remove AI-generated comments
- Add comprehensive contribution guidelines  
- Update documentation for contributors
- Set up release automation"

# Push current state
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Create Public Branch
```bash
# Create and switch to public branch
git checkout -b public
git push -u origin public

# Set public as default branch for collaborators
# (This should be done in GitHub settings)
```

### Step 3: Clean Up Sensitive Information
Review and remove any:
- Personal paths or credentials
- Development-specific configurations
- Proprietary or sensitive comments
- Local file references

## üîÑ Branch Management Strategy

### Branches
- `main` - Stable development branch (maintainer access)
- `public` - Public collaboration branch (open PRs)
- `release/*` - Release preparation branches
- Feature branches from `public`

### Workflow
1. Contributors fork and create branches from `public`
2. Submit PRs to `public` branch
3. Maintainers review and merge to `public`
4. Periodic merges from `public` to `main`
5. Releases cut from `main`

This ensures a stable main branch while enabling open collaboration!
